Data Wrangling With MongoDB<br />
OSM dataset for the city of Vancouver, BC, Canada, is explored and audited, and some issues are fixed.<br />
The OSM file is in XML format. It is transformed to JSON and exported to MongoDB for further exploration.<br />
> The HTML file "Data Analyst Udacity Nanodegree - Data Wrangling Project" follows the Project Rubric, and documents my data wrangling process.
> All python codes from Lesson 6 quizzes adapted for this particular project are included; Iterative Parsing corresponds to auditing_tags, Tag Types to audit_regular_expression, Exploring Users to set_of_users, Improving Street Names to improve_street_names, and Preparing For Database to xml_to_dicts. The code bounds is used to complement auditing_tags, and the code mongodb_collection is used to import de dataset to MongoDB.
> The file vancouver_canada.osm is the original file. With improve_street_names a new XML file my_vancouver.xml is created, and xml_to_dicts creates a JSON file.
